# About this Project
This project explores and visualizes the trajectory of a colormap within the 3D RGB color space. Instead of just showing the colormap itself, it plots the path that the color takes as it transitions from one end of the map to the other. This unique approach provides valuable insight into the perceptual and geometric properties of different colormaps.

# Why is this useful?
Understanding a colormap's trajectory in RGB space helps in several ways:

Perceptual Uniformity: A colormap that moves smoothly and consistently through the color space is more likely to be perceptually uniform, meaning equal changes in data correspond to equal perceived changes in color. A winding or erratic path might indicate a non-uniform colormap.

Color Gamut Usage: The trajectory shows how much of the available color space a colormap utilizes. A "fuller" path might be more effective for visualizing a wide range of data values.

Troubleshooting: It can help identify issues in custom colormaps, such as unexpected sharp turns or flat spots where the color isn't changing much.

# Key Features
Interactive 3D Visualization: The project generates an interactive plot of the colormap's path in the RGB cube.

Multiple Colormap Support: It can analyze standard colormaps (e.g., viridis, plasma, jet) as well as custom colormaps.

Insightful Analysis: The visualization helps you intuitively understand the underlying structure of a colormap.
